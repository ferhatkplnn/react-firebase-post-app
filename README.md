# Firebase Post Application
[DEMO](https://splash-posts.netlify.app/)

This application is a simple post-sharing app developed using React, Firebase, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. Users can register, log in, and then share posts. Additionally, there is a notification section on the right side of the main page, displaying notifications for new registered users and new posts.  
I wrote this application to learn firebase a little bit.
